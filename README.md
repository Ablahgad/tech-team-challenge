#### YOUR TASK:
Make a responsive web page for the F!ROSH website that displays information about the F!ROSH Orientation Committee. 

The provided data is in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, in the  `src/members_details.json` file, and includes details like the name, position, and picture for each member. Feel free to look up resources and tutorials about JSON. 

Your goal is to create a visually appealing and responsive layout using React JS, CSS, and HTML. Again, if you do not have experience with React JS, thatâ€™s also okay! We want to see how quickly you can learn to use it. Feel free to look up any resources to help you with this task.

The goal of the website is to present users with introductory information about the Orientation Committee. 

#### SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Commit your changes to your forked repository 
2. Create a pull request (PR) to the original repository; this will be your submission! Please ensure you use the provided template for the description of your PR.
